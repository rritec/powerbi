53. What is row-level security?

    Row-level security limits the data a user can view and has access to, and it relies on filters. 
    Users can define the rules and roles in Power BI Desktop and also publish them to Power BI Service to configure row-level security.
    
54. Define bi-directional cross filtering?

    Bidirectional cross-filtering enables them to apply filters on both sides of a table relationship. 
    You can apply the filters by propagating the filter context to a second related table on the other side of a table relationship.

55. What is "M language"?

    M is a programming language used in Power Query as a functional, case-sensitive language similar to other programming languages and easy to use.

    Visual-level filters are used to filter data within a single visualization. Page-level filters are used to work on an entire page in a report, and 
    different pages can have various filters. 
    Report-level filters are used to filter all the visualizations and pages in the report.

57. What are KPIs in Power BI?

    KPI is abbreviated as Key Performance Indicator. Any professional organization has teams and employees follow the KPI protocols. The organizations set 
    up KPIs for all the employees. These KPIs act as their targets. These KPIs are compared to previous performance and analyze the progress.

58. What is the incremental refresh in the context of Power BI?

    2.Vertical Joins to merge the data from multiple tables

60. Divide Function Vs Divide Operator
- It's recommended that you use the **DIVIDE function** whenever the denominator is an expression that could return zero or BLANK.
- In the case that the denominator is a **constant value**, we recommend that you use the **divide operator**. In this case, the division is guaranteed to succeed, and your expression will perform better because it will avoid unnecessary testing.
- [Refer document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/best-practices/dax-divide-function-operator)

66. Difference between treat as and filter dax functions ?
- TREATAS and FILTER are both DAX functions used for filtering data, but they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases:
- TREATAS Function:
	- Purpose: TREATAS is used to establish a virtual relationship between tables by applying a filter context from one table to another, even when no physical relationship exists between them in the data model.
	- Syntax: TREATAS(<table_or_expression_to_use_as_filter_context>, <table_to_filter>)
	- Use Case: You would use TREATAS when you want to create a temporary relationship between tables for a specific calculation or analysis. For instance, when you want to filter one table based on values in another table without creating a physical relationship in the data model.
	- Example: If you have two tables, Sales and Product, without a direct relationship, you can use TREATAS to filter the Product table based on values from the Sales table.
 - FILTER Function:
	- Purpose: FILTER is used to create a new table by filtering an existing table based on a specified condition or expression.
	- Syntax: FILTER(<table>, <filter_expression>)
	- Use Case: You would use FILTER when you want to filter rows within a single table based on specific criteria. This is often used for creating subsets of data within a single table.
	- Example: If you have a Sales table and you want to filter it to include only rows where the sales amount is greater than 1000, you would use the FILTER function.
	- In summary, the key difference between the two functions is that TREATAS is primarily used to establish temporary relationships between tables, whereas FILTER is used to filter rows within a single table. Your choice between them depends on the specific data modeling or analysis scenario you are working on.

67. Performance tunning in powerbi?

Performance tuning in Power BI is crucial to ensure that your reports and dashboards load and respond quickly, providing a smooth user experience. Here are some tips for optimizing the performance of your Power BI reports:

1. **Data Model Optimization**:
   - **Data Loading**: Limit the data loaded into your Power BI model. Only load the data that is necessary for your analysis.
   - **Data Transformation**: Optimize data transformation steps in Power Query to reduce data size.
   - **Data Type Selection**: Choose appropriate data types for your columns to reduce memory usage.
   - **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Remove columns you don't need for analysis to reduce data size.
   - **Data Compression**: Enable data compression when possible to reduce memory footprint.

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - **Star Schema**: Use a star schema for your data model, with a central fact table and dimension tables. This can improve query performance.
   - **Relationships**: Define relationships between tables efficiently. Use one-to-many relationships when appropriate.
   - **Bi-Directional Filtering**: Use bi-directional filtering with caution, as it can affect performance.

3. **DAX Optimization**:
   - **Measure Optimization**: Write efficient DAX measures. Avoid using complex DAX functions that slow down performance.
   - **Row-Level Security**: If you use Row-Level Security, make sure it's optimized to avoid excessive data filtering.

4. **Aggregations**:
   - Use aggregations to pre-calculate and store summary data for large datasets. This can significantly improve query performance.

5. **Filter Optimization**:
   - Minimize the number of visual-level filters. Excessive filters can slow down report performance.
   - Use slicers and filters strategically to limit the data loaded.

6. **Visual Design**:
   - Use summarization and drill-through features to provide a balance between detail and performance.
   - Limit the number of visuals on a single report page.
   - Use visuals with caution, especially if they have a large number of data points.

7. **Performance Analyzer**:
   - Use Power BI's built-in Performance Analyzer to identify bottlenecks in your report. It helps pinpoint slow-performing visuals or DAX measures.

8. **Data Refresh Schedule**:
   - Schedule data refresh during off-peak times to minimize the impact on the Power BI Service's performance.

9. **Power BI Service Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of dataset size limitations in the Power BI Service.
   - Utilize the Power BI Premium or Premium Per User (PPU) capacities for better performance.

10. **Monitor Usage**:
    - Use the Power BI Service's usage metrics and monitoring tools to identify reports that need optimization.

11. **Regular Testing**:
    - Continuously test your reports and measures for performance as your data and report complexity grow.

Remember that performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review and optimize your Power BI reports as data and business requirements evolve to ensure that your reports remain responsive and provide a good user experience.
